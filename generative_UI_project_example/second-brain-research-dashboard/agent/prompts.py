CONTENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are an expert content analyst specializing in Markdown document classification and entity extraction.

Your task is to analyze the provided Markdown document and extract structured information about its content, type, and key entities.

## Document to Analyze

{markdown_content}

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Document Classification
Classify this document into ONE of the following types based on its primary purpose and structure:

- **tutorial**: Step-by-step guides with code examples and hands-on instructions
- **research**: Academic papers, research notes, analysis, or data-driven content
- **article**: Blog posts, news articles, opinion pieces, or general writing
- **guide**: Reference documentation, comprehensive overviews, or how-to guides
- **notes**: Personal notes, quick references, or informal documentation
- **technical_doc**: API documentation, technical specifications, or developer references
- **overview**: High-level summaries, introductions, or executive briefings

**Classification Criteria:**
- Look at the document structure (headers, sections, formatting)
- Identify the primary intent (teach, inform, reference, document)
- Consider the target audience (beginners, researchers, developers, general readers)
- Analyze the content density and complexity

### 2. Entity Extraction
Extract the following entities from the document:

**Technologies**: Frameworks, platforms, libraries, services
Examples: React, TensorFlow, AWS, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes

**Tools**: Development tools, applications, utilities
Examples: VS Code, Git, npm, Webpack, Pytest, Postman

**Programming Languages**: All mentioned programming or markup languages
Examples: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Rust, Go

**Key Concepts**: Important topics, methodologies, patterns mentioned in headers
Examples: Machine Learning, REST API, Microservices, CI/CD

### 3. Structural Analysis
Identify:
- Main title (from first H1 header or document start)
- Number of sections and subsections
- Presence of code blocks, tables, links
- Special content types (YouTube videos, GitHub repos, diagrams)

## Output Format

Return a structured analysis with:
- `document_type`: One of the classification types above
- `title`: The main document title
- `entities`: Dictionary with keys: technologies, tools, languages, concepts
- `confidence`: Your confidence score (0.0-1.0) in the classification
- `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why you chose this classification

## Example Output Structure

```json
{{
  "document_type": "tutorial",
  "title": "Building REST APIs with FastAPI",
  "entities": {{
    "technologies": ["FastAPI", "Pydantic", "PostgreSQL"],
    "tools": ["pip", "uvicorn", "Postman"],
    "languages": ["Python", "SQL"],
    "concepts": ["REST API", "Data Validation", "Async Programming"]
  }},
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Document contains step-by-step code examples with explanations, targeting developers learning FastAPI. Clear instructional structure with numbered sections."
}}
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Accurate**: Choose the classification that best matches the primary document purpose
2. **Extract Comprehensively**: Don't miss important technologies or concepts
3. **Normalize Names**: Use standard capitalization (Python, not python; PostgreSQL, not postgres)
4. **Focus on Relevance**: Only extract entities that are actually discussed, not just mentioned in passing
5. **Provide Context**: Make your reasoning clear and specific to this document

- **NEVER use relative paths** like `/docs`, `./api`, or `#section`
- **NEVER use localhost URLs**
- If you cannot find a valid external URL for a resource, DO NOT create the component

- **PriorityBadge**: Priority level badge (low, medium, high, critical)
- **DifficultyBadge**: Difficulty level badge (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert)

## COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE RULES (CRITICAL)

You MUST follow these rules to ensure thorough content representation:

### Rule 1: Cover ALL Major Content Sections
- **Generate a component for EVERY major section/topic in the document**
- If document has 10 sections/topics, generate components for ALL 10, not just 2-3
- Bullet points WITHIN a section should be collapsed into a SINGLE component (KeyTakeaways, CalloutCard, or ChecklistItem) — do NOT create one RankedItem per bullet point
- Only use RankedItem for content that is explicitly ranked/ordered (e.g., "Top 10 tools")
- Minimum: Generate 1-2 components per major section + summary components

### Rule 2: Scale With Document Size
- Short documents (< 500 words): 5-8 components
- Medium documents (500-2000 words): 10-15 components
- Long documents (2000+ words): 15-25 components
- IMPORTANT: Stay within these ranges. More is NOT better — aim for information density per component.

### Rule 3: Minimum Component Type Diversity
- **Generate at least 4 DIFFERENT component types** in your selection
- Do NOT create 10 components of only 2-3 types
- Mix structural, data, media, and interactive components

### Rule 4: No Consecutive Repetition
- **Never place 3+ components of the same type consecutively**
- If you need multiple StatCards, intersperse them with other components
- Break up patterns with different component types

### Rule 5: Balanced Distribution
- Aim for 2-4 instances of your most-used component type
- Include 1-2 instances of several other component types
- Avoid having one component type dominate (>50% of components)

### Rule 6: Width Hints
For each component, you may suggest a `width_hint` in the props to control layout:
- **"full"**: Spans entire width - use for code blocks, tables, summaries, executive content
- **"half"**: Half width (2 columns on desktop) - use for callouts, key points, quotes
- **"third"**: Third width (3 columns on desktop) - use for stat cards, link cards, repo cards
- **"quarter"**: Small items - use for badges, tags

Default widths are applied if not specified, but you can override for visual balance.
Group similar-width components together when possible.

### Rule 7: Semantic Zones (IMPORTANT)
Assign each component to a semantic zone for intelligent layout:
- **"hero"**: Top of page, full-width prominent content. Use for: TLDR, ExecutiveSummary, main headline
- **"metrics"**: Key statistics and data. Use for: StatCard, TrendIndicator, MetricRow, ProgressRing
- **"insights"**: Main content area. Use for: KeyTakeaways, CalloutCard, QuoteCard, ExpertTip, RankedItem
- **"content"**: Primary detailed content. Use for: CodeBlock, DataTable, StepCard, ChecklistItem, ProConItem
- **"media"**: Videos, images, embeds. Use for: VideoCard, ImageCard, PlaylistCard, PodcastCard
- **"resources"**: Links and references. Use for: LinkCard, ToolCard, BookCard, RepoCard
- **"tags"**: Categories and labels. Use for: TagCloud, CategoryBadge, StatusIndicator

Components in the same zone will be grouped together visually. Use zones to create a clear visual hierarchy.

## Component Selection Strategy

Follow this process:

### Step 1: Identify Key Content Elements
- What are the most important pieces of information?
- What content types are present? (code, data, media, text)
- What's the primary user goal? (learn, reference, consume)

### Step 2: Map Content to Components
- Code blocks → CodeBlock
- Statistics/metrics → StatCard, MetricRow, ComparisonBar
- Links → LinkCard, ToolCard, RepoCard, BookCard
- Steps/procedures → StepCard, ChecklistItem
- Media → VideoCard, ImageCard
- Summaries → TLDR, KeyTakeaways, ExecutiveSummary

### Step 2b: Content Pattern Matching (IMPORTANT)
Match these content patterns to the BEST component type:
- Direct quotes with attribution → **QuoteCard** (NOT RankedItem or BulletPoint)
- News stories with dates/sources → **HeadlineCard** (with appropriate sentiment: positive/negative/neutral)
- Statistics with numbers/percentages → **StatCard** or **TrendIndicator**
- Chronological events, upcoming dates, or timelines → **TimelineEvent**
- Named people with roles/titles → **ProfileCard**
- Lists of resources/tools with URLs → **ToolCard** or **LinkCard**
- Pro/con or advantage/disadvantage content → **ProConItem**
- Step-by-step instructions → **StepCard**
- Grouped short items (funding rounds, product launches) → **CalloutCard** with grouped content
- Expert tips or advice → **ExpertTip**
- Key statistics in a group → **MetricRow** for related metrics together

### Sentiment Guidelines for HeadlineCards
Assign accurate sentiment:
- **positive**: achievements, breakthroughs, funding, launches, growth, improvements, open-source releases
- **negative**: failures, layoffs, bans, restrictions, losses, declines, security breaches
- **neutral**: policy announcements without clear positive/negative framing, mixed outcomes
Do NOT default everything to "neutral" - analyze the actual tone of the content.

### Step 3: Enforce Variety
- Check component type counts
- Insert different component types to break up repetition
- Add complementary components (e.g., TableOfContents for long content)

### Step 4: Organize with Layout Components
- Group related components in Sections
- Use Grid for card-based content
- Use Accordion for lengthy collapsible content
- Use Tabs for categorized information

## Output Format

Return a JSON array of component specifications:

{{
  "components": [
    {{"component_type": "TLDR", "zone": "hero", "priority": "high", "props": {{"width_hint": "full"}}}},
    {{"component_type": "StatCard", "zone": "metrics", "priority": "high", "props": {{"width_hint": "third"}}}},

  "variety_check": {{
    "unique_types_count": 8,
    "max_consecutive_same_type": 2,
    "meets_requirements": true
  }}
}}
```

## Example Bad Selection (AVOID - NOT DIVERSE)

```json
{{
  "components": [
    {{"component_type": "StatCard"}},
    {{"component_type": "StatCard"}},
    {{"component_type": "StatCard"}},
    {{"component_type": "StatCard"}},
    {{"component_type": "StatCard"}},
    {{"component_type": "StatCard"}},
    {{"component_type": "CodeBlock"}},
    {{"component_type": "CodeBlock"}},
    {{"component_type": "CodeBlock"}},
    {{"component_type": "CodeBlock"}}
  ],
  "variety_check": {{
    "unique_types_count": 2,
    "max_consecutive_same_type": 6,
    "meets_requirements": false
  }}
}}
```
❌ This violates BOTH variety rules!

## Important Guidelines

1. **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: Generate a component for EVERY major section — do NOT skip sections after the first few
2. **Diversity First**: Aim for 6-8 different component types minimum. No single type should exceed 40% of total.
3. **Break Up Patterns**: Never have more than 2 consecutive identical components
4. **Use Width Hints**: Specify width_hint for visual balance (third for stats, full for code/tables, half for callouts)
5. **Use Semantic Zones**: ALWAYS assign a zone to each component (hero, metrics, insights, content, media, resources, tags)
6. **Match Content to Best Type**: Use QuoteCard for quotes, HeadlineCard for news, StatCard for numbers, TimelineEvent for events
7. **Provide Complete Props**: Include all necessary data for each component
8. **Consolidate Lists**: Bullet points within a section go into ONE component (KeyTakeaways, CalloutCard) — not one RankedItem per bullet
9. **Stay in Range**: 15-25 components for long documents. More is not better.
